      <h1>Welcome to ROC event application</h1>

<div id='intro'>
    <p>Founded by Trena Matos-Ambroise in 2009, ROC began a passionate movement of the soul.
    After the tragic death of 13 year old neighbor, Steven Odom, a hole was left in the heart of the neighborhood. <br><br>

    Trena knew the community needed to come together so Trena, along with a few fellow neighbors, went door-to-door with clipboards collecting names, contact info and inviting people to attend a meeting at the True Vine Church;
    where Steven’s parents, Kim and Ronald Odom are pastors.<br><br>

    The people who attended continued to meet and decided to form an official group, creating the name Redefining Our Community.
    The meetings became the planning grounds for multiple projects and events, resulting in the birth of one of Boston’s most thriving organizations.</p>

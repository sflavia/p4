## Details for teaching team

This was an attempt to create a event planner application- I really thought this was going to be more manageable but turned out to be a bit more challenging than anticipated.  really wanted to create a messaging board and I will continue to work on that
overall the class was amazing and as a new coder I'm looking forward to developing and improving over the coming moths
